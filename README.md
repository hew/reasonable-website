## Why this Project?

I started this project mostly to learn Reasonml: how will this language UI development? What new patterns are there? Etc.

## Project Goals

Eventually, I'd like for this to be a production-ready website boilerplate for pure Reason. For now, I'm going to keep picking away at different [issues](https://github.com/hew/reasonable-website/issues/) in an attempt to further my learning. Contributions are welcome.
