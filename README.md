# Reasonable Website

Reasonable Website (RW) is a pure Reasonml website boilerplate. (Built off [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hew/reasonable-website.git
```

## Why

I started RW mostly to learn Reasonml: new patterns, etc, as it pertains to web UI development.

## Project Goals

Eventually, I'd like for this to be a production-ready website boilerplate. The main stuff I want to tackle:

* Tests
* (More to come...)

Contributions are welcome.
