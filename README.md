# Reasonable Website

Reasonable Website (RW) is a pure Reasonml website boilerplate. (Built off [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))

## Why

I started RW mostly to learn Reasonml: new patterns, etc, as it pertains to web UI development.

## Features

* Routing (reason-react)
* Fetch (bs-fetch)
* Decoding (bs-json)

## Project Goals

Eventually, I'd like for this to be a production-ready website boilerplate. The main stuff I want to tackle:

* Tests
* (More to come...)

Contributions are welcome.
